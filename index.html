                <p>Maha Shivaratri, also known as Mahashivaratri, is a Hindu festival celebrated in honor of Lord Shiva. It is observed on the 14th night of the dark fortnight in the Hindu month of Phalguna (February-March) and marks the convergence of Shiva and Shakti, symbolizing the cosmic union.

                The word "Maha Shivaratri" translates to "the great night of Shiva." Devotees believe that on this night, Lord Shiva performed the cosmic dance of creation, preservation, and destruction. It is considered a time for prayer, meditation, and spiritual activities dedicated to Lord Shiva.</p>
